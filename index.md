I'm a **software developer** and **a tech enthusiast**.

I live in **Krak√≥w**, **Poland**. I'm curious how everything around works and how to improve it. I love to learn new things.

For a living I'm doing TV related social media analytics software at [u2i.com](http://u2i.com/).

I learned serious programming with **Java**, which remains closest to my heart. I had a romance with **Erlang** which fascinated my with its functional nature and actor model. Some time ago I decided to check what life is like in dynamically typed languages, so I picked up **Ruby** with its shining framework **Rails**. Recently I've been playing with **Golang** and its absolutely amazing built-in concurrency.

I've been always interested in **algorithms**, **performance** and working with **high volumes of data**. I like making computer programs run faster.

After hours I'm a **runner**, **skier**, **progressive rock** lover, bad **guitar player** and high sea **sailor**.
