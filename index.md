I'm a **software developer** and **a tech enthusiast**.

I live in **Krak√≥w**, **Poland**. I like to know how stuff around me works and how to improve it. I love learning new things.

I've been always interested in **algorithms**, **performance** and working with **high volumes of data**. I like to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in databases and data processing engines.

I learned programming with **Java**, which remains closest to my heart. I had a romance with **Erlang** which fascinated me with its functional nature and actor model. Some time ago I decided to check what life is like in dynamically typed languages, so I picked up **Ruby** with its shining framework **Rails**. I've been also playing with **Go** and its absolutely amazing built-in concurrency.

After hours I'm a **runner**, **skier**, **progressive rock** lover, bad **guitar player** and high sea **sailor**.
